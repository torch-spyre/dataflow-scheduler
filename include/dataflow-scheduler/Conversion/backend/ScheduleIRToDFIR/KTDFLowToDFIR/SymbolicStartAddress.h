/// A tensor's start address can arrive as an input to the kernel rather than as
/// a constant: the host decides where the tensor lives, and the compiler is
/// told only that there is an address, not which one. In DataflowIR such an
/// address is a *symbol* -- `symbol.create_symbol` carrying the id that stands
/// for it -- and whatever runs the program writes the real value into every
/// instruction the symbol reached.
///
/// The symbol stands alone as the start address, so that what has to be written
/// over is a whole operand and code generation needs no form for an expression
/// over a placeholder. An address that is an expression over an input therefore
/// becomes a symbol of its own, and what it is computed from is said
/// separately, as arithmetic the IR carries alongside:
///
/// ```mlir
///   // -1 is the input; -3 is -1 + 24576.
///   symbol.create_id %arg0 {symbol_id = -1 : si64} : index
///   %0 = arith.addi %arg0, %c24576 : index
///   symbol.create_id %0 {symbol_id = -3 : si64} : index
///   %sym = symbol.create_symbol {SymbolId = -3 : i64} : index
///   %v = dataflow.get_logical_memory_view %unit, %sym {layout_map = ...}
/// ```
///
/// Nothing reads `%0`. It is there so that whatever resolves the symbols can
/// read what each one is from the IR rather than being told separately -- the
/// declarations *are* the table.
///
/// An address that varies with the grid element -- each one working on its own
/// slab of a tensor -- is one symbol per grid element rather than one overall.
/// Which slab that is can be said in either of two ways, and they come to the
/// same thing here: as arithmetic over the input at the view, so the address
/// the view is built on already differs; or as one view of the whole tensor
/// with an access tile whose offset into it is the grid element's, which is a
/// displacement of that view's address by the time it is lowered. Either way
/// the symbols are gathered into a uniform map keyed on the unit, so the start
/// address a program reads is the query, and each grid element's own symbol is
/// what gets written:
///
/// ```mlir
///   %m = uniform.def_immutable_mapping([%u0 -> %sym0], [%u1 -> %sym1]):index
///   %q = uniform.query_map(map:%m, key:%iter_arg) : index
///   %v = dataflow.get_logical_memory_view %unit, %q {layout_map = ...}
/// ```
///
/// In KTIR the address reaches `ktdp.construct_memory_view` as an expression
/// over a block argument: the kernel takes the argument in its own signature,
/// and splitting the kernel into per-schedule programs threads it down as an
/// argument of each program function that reads it.
///
