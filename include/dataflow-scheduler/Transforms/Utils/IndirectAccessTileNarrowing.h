// Shared helpers for narrowing a ktdp_lowering.construct_indirect_access_tile
// op by one dimension and propagating that narrowing through its downstream
// shaped-value graph.
//
// Two strategies eliminate a dimension's degree of freedom as each loop is
// materialized:
//   - Dropping: the dimension is deleted outright, so rank decreases by one
//     (dropDimFromIntegerSet, dropDimFromAffineMap, dropShapeDim). This is
//     the default, used for values with no base-memref rank to preserve.
//   - Pinning: the dimension is kept but its extent is fixed to 1 and its
//     subscript becomes the current loop induction variable, so rank is
//     unchanged (pinDimInIntegerSet, rebuildAccessTilePinned).
//
// Access tiles built on a base memref (addr_buf, destination access tile,
// source access tile) must use pinning instead of the drop-narrowing
// everything else gets, because dropping would break the
// ConstructAccessTilesOp invariant `access_tile_set.numDims ==
// base_map.numInputs == base memref rank`. This file calls that substitution
// "pin-not-drop": pinDestAccessTile()/pinSourceAccessTile() rebuild those
// access tiles pinned to a growing list of loop induction variables, in place
// of the drop that propagateNarrowing() would otherwise apply to them. Used
// by IndirectAddrBufLegalization's window and entry loop materialization.
