/// The IndirectComputeGroupSplit pass runs immediately after
/// ComputeGroupExtraction and splits each extracted child-module function
/// containing a ktdp.construct_indirect_access_tile into two sibling
/// child-module functions:
///
///   - @<name>_idx_to_addr resolves raw integer indices to flat absolute
///     addresses and stores them into a global address buffer.
///   - @<name> loads that buffer into the IAB and performs the actual
///     gather/scatter through ktdp_lowering.construct_indirect_access_tile.
///
/// The orchestrator is updated to call the first before the second.  The two
/// meet primarily at the address buffer, whose address is a compile-time
/// constant both of them materialize; @<name>_idx_to_addr may additionally
/// take whatever block arguments its address computation cannot do without
/// (an index memref or data-tensor base or stride that is not a compile-time
/// constant), forwarded from @<name>'s own call site.
///
/// Each candidate is handled in two phases.  analyzeCandidate() and the helpers
/// it calls are pure: they validate the input and derive everything the rewrite
/// will need, but mutate nothing.  splitCandidate() then drives the three
/// rewrite steps — buildIdxToAddrModule(), rewriteGatherScatterModule() and
/// updateOrchestrator() — none of which can fail.  That split is what lets an
/// input the pass cannot handle be diagnosed with the IR still exactly as it
/// was found, rather than left half-transformed.
